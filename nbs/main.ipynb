    "# Dow Jones Technical Assignment\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Dataset Selection\n",
    "For this assignment, I am using the [Yahoo Finance News Dataset (2023)](https://github.com/FelixDrinkall/financial-news-dataset/blob/main/data/2023_processed.json.xz), which contains real-world financial news articles published on finance.yahoo.com during the year 2023. The dataset is part of a broader collection covering the years 2017–2023 and available in the following [link](https://github.com/felixdrinkall/financial-news-dataset).\n",
    "#### Rationale\n",
    "I selected the 2023 dataset because it provides recent, high-quality financial news articles from multiple reputable media sources, closely resembling what would be available to a financial media company like Dow Jones. This ensures:\n",
    "- Realistic input for summarization and semantic search.\n",
    "- Diverse content, including company earnings, market movements, and macroeconomic developments.\n",
    "- Clean article metadata such as date when the article was published, original link, title and full text.\n",
    "#### Licensing\n",
    "The dataset is distributed under the [Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International (CC BY-NC-SA 4.0) License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/). This allows for academic use, sharing, and adaptation, while restricting commercial applications."

       "'Amid rising awareness of food waste’s environmental and economic toll, the upcycling movement is gaining momentum across the food industry, exemplified by Salt & Straw’s innovative ice cream flavors crafted from leftover ingredients. Portland-based Malek’s chain champions the reuse of whey, rice remnants, and cacao pulp, transforming waste into gourmet products while advocating for a shift from “food waste” to “wasted food.” This trend aligns with consumer demand for transparency and sustainability, as over 35 million tons of food are wasted annually in the U.S., costing the economy over $200 billion. The Upcycled Food Association’s “Upcycling Certified” seal now adorns hundreds of products, from bakery mixes to veggie chips, highlighting ingredients like misshapen produce and byproducts from plant-based milk, such as okara flour used in Salt & Straw’s cupcakes. Beyond retail, innovative restaurants like San Francisco’s Shuggie’s Trash Pie utilize imperfect produce and offcuts, challenging perceptions of quality and reducing waste at the source. As the movement expands, it underscores a critical shift toward a more sustainable, resource-efficient food system, driven by consumer awareness and industry innovation.'"
