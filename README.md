## Assignment

Objective: The purpose of this assignment is to assess your skills in Natural Language
Processing (NLP), Information Retrieval (IR), Generative AI, and Semantic Search. You will
need to source an open dataset, perform an in-depth analysis, build a model, and derive
actionable insights.

Assignment Description: You are tasked with sourcing an open dataset related to textual data
and using it to address a problem of your choice within the realm of NLP, IR, Gen AI, or
Semantic Search. The focus can be on tasks such as text classification, summarization, topic

modeling, question answering, media recommendations, or semantic search.
Tasks:
1. Dataset Sourcing:
○ Identify and select a free, open dataset relevant to NLP or text analysis.
○ Provide a brief justification for the chosen dataset and its relevance to the task.
2. Problem Definition:
○ Clearly define the problem you intend to solve using the chosen dataset.
○ Explain why this problem is significant and what impact solving it might have.
3. Approach and Pipeline:
○ Outline your approach to solving the problem.
○ Describe the tools, libraries, and frameworks you plan to use.
○ Detail your pipeline, including data preprocessing, feature engineering, model
building, and evaluation.
4. Implementation:
○ Implement your pipeline in a Jupyter notebook.
○ Ensure that your code is well-documented and includes explanations for each
step.
○ Visualize and explain your results.
5. Evaluation:
○ Evaluate the performance of your model(s) using appropriate metrics.
○ Discuss the strengths and limitations of your approach.
6. Recommendations:
○ Offer recommendations for potential improvements or next steps.
Be ready to present your findings and answer questions in a follow-up interview.
Submission Requirements:
● Jupyter notebook with your code and detailed explanations.
Evaluation Criteria:
● Clarity and significance of the problem definition.
● Appropriateness and rationale behind the chosen approach and tools.
● Performance and evaluation of the model(s).
● Clarity and professionalism of the presentation.
